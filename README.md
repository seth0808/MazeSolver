# MazeSolver
Solve any maze using dijkstra's algorithm 

This program takes advantage of Processing 3(Open project initiated by Ben Fry and Casey Reas) IDE and its graphic libraries.

Processing calls the setup() initially and then loops your draw() function. The file Graph.pde will contain these methods and should be the main file of the project. Maze.pde and Tile.pde are classes that are accessed by the Graph.pde file. All files are written in Java.  

This is a project I made mid semester during the fall 2017 term. Dijkstra's was a topic covered in class and I thought this application of it would be something fun to do in my free time.
